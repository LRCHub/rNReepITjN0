```lrc
[00:07.12] I never stay in one place too long
[00:09.92] A dirt road's singing me a siren song
[00:13.28] I gotta find a field
[00:18.37] I need to spin my wheels
[00:20.64] I got a hankering for four wide tires
[00:23.66] And I can't help it, it's the way I'm wired
[00:27.05] 'Fore you get too close
[00:30.24] Boy, you need to know
[00:40.74] 
[00:33.60] I got a heart like a truck
[00:37.27] It's been drug through the mud
[00:40.31] Runs on dreams and gasoline
[00:43.37] And that ole highway holds the key
[01:00.37] 
[00:46.93] It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
[00:50.68] Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
[00:54.01] A little bit of love is all that it's needing
[00:57.54] But it's good as it is tough
[01:00.22] I got a heart like a truck
[01:13.22] 
[01:05.41] There ain't no breaking when I throw it in drive
[01:08.56] Don't always keep it in between the lines
[01:11.76] If you're ready for a ride, pedal down state of mind
[01:15.05] Boy, I tell you what
[01:16.21] You better buckle up
[01:26.21] 
[01:18.17] I got a heart like a truck
[01:21.73] It's been drug through the mud
[01:24.99] Runs on dreams and gasoline
[01:28.13] And that ole highway holds the key
[01:45.13] 
[01:31.82] It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
[01:35.27] Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
[01:38.49] A little bit of love is all that it's needing
[01:42.30] But it's good as it is tough
[01:45.01] I got a heart like a truck
[01:58.01] 
[01:59.12] Go out and see if you can knock off the dust, yeah
[02:02.62] Shine it up, rev it up and let it run, yeah
[02:06.20] It gets a high riding off into the sun, yeah
[02:28.20] 
[02:13.20] I got a heart like a truck
[02:16.56] It's been drug through the mud
[02:19.76] Runs on dreams and gasoline
[02:23.14] And that ole highway holds the key
[02:40.14] 
[02:26.51] It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
[02:30.07] Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
[02:33.42] A little bit of love is all that it's needing
[02:37.13] But it's good as it is tough
[02:39.75] I got a heart like a truck
[02:52.75] 
[02:54.14] Go on and see if you can knock off the dust, yeah
[02:57.61] Shine it up, rev it up and let it run, yeah
[03:01.15] It gets a high riding off into the sun, yeah
[03:04.78] It gets a high riding off into the sun
